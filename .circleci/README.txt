outfile is a list of a bunch of unspendable addresses that I made, often by
padding the final characters myself before sending.  This seems to work 
just fine, but you will notice some strangeness like a bunch of ones (1) and sometimes
a random D.  When I tried to bring all of this into the python file, it crapped out.
