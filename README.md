# Usage
```
Examples:
=> ./unspendable.py DCx "fun.times () { ls ~; }"
DCxFUN1TiMESxdbxqxLSxnjxpzzzAyhAmP
=> ./unspendable.py DCx "this is the stuff"
DCxTHiSxiSxTHExSTUFFzzzzzzzzCnzYCP

In dogecoin, 9s-9z and the A range should also work, but at
least DCx seems good now.

[[ master is currently broken, but the code in v1.0 works ]]
[[ some examples that I created are in the .circleci subdir ]]
